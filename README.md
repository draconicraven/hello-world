Trying out git for the first time!!!

I like tooling around with different operating system setups. Unfortunately, I also like tooling around with coding and moving physical files around depending on which OS I happen to be on is becoming tiresome. So, here I am.

This edit is being made on a local machine to try out a git client.

I'm adding another edit because I'm trying out gitAhead. It seems that gitKraken is a little too restrictive, for my taste, with its free version.
